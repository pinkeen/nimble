TODO:
REMEMBER - KISS!

* refactoring, refactoring, refactoring ;)
* optimizing ;|
* testing & bugfixing :/

* !!!! fix color wrapping (currently wraps at 1.0f)
- ! narrow phase collision detection (concave polygons anyone?) [point in polygon?]
	DONE: concave polygons tesselation into convex ones + separating axis theorem test
* !! reading animation definitions from file
* !! configurator is a stub (write ConfigFile class)
* !!! bitmap fonts (behaving like any other sprites)
* !? quadtree (or other spatial hashing) based collision culling (broadphase)
* looped sprites
* audio engine (SDL_mixer wrapper)
* mouse support (trivial)
* joystick support
* generic particle class
* more ViewTransition classes!
	* "Loading..." view transition (progress callback with ImageManagerProxy?)
* ? more sophisticated FrameLimiter (adaptive could overcompensate after high load)
	* not limiting FrameLimiter for performance testing
* tools to ease creating BoundingShape's and animation definition files etc.
* full screen shaders for ogl backend (fbos? rendertotexture?)
* sprite engine (graphics backend) shall have a clipping rect
* doxygen api docs
* tutorials and examples
* pure SDL (software?) graphics backend
* attaching one sprite to another (kind of skeletel anims possible)
* ? custom shaders attachable to sprites
* ? drawing primitives
* ? persistence framework for saving
* ? logger is ugly (is it?)
* tilemap support (with editor)
	Needing user to write/extend sprite factory. (? Generic factory allowing
	registration name/factory func pointer?)

* release and relax
* more and more ideas will come...
